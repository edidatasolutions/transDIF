# Contributing to transDIF

Thank you for your interest in transDIF. Bug reports, questions, suggestions and
code contributions are all welcome.

## Getting help

- Start with the documentation: the package website (https://edidatasolutions.github.io/transDIF/),
  the vignette (`vignette("transDIF")`) and the help pages (`?td_...`).
- For questions about using the package, open an issue at https://github.com/edidatasolutions/transDIF/issues
  and describe what you are trying to do.

## Reporting a bug

Please open an issue at https://github.com/edidatasolutions/transDIF/issues with:

1. A short description of the problem and what you expected instead.
2. A **minimal reproducible example**. The package's simulation function
   (`td_simulate()`) is usually the easiest way to create example data without
   sharing real examinee records.
3. The output of `sessionInfo()`.

**Never post real candidate, examinee or item data in an issue.** If a problem
only appears with confidential data, describe it in general terms, or email the
maintainer (address in the `DESCRIPTION` file) to discuss how to share it safely.

## Suggesting a feature

Open an issue describing the use case (the measurement problem you need to
solve), not only the proposed function. Methodological suggestions with
references are especially welcome.

## Contributing code

1. Open an issue first to discuss the change, unless it is a small fix
   (typos, documentation).
2. Fork the repository and create a branch for your change.
3. Follow the existing style: base R in `Imports`, the
   `td_` function prefix, roxygen2 documentation with runnable `@examples`.
4. Add or update tests in `tests/test-core.R`. New statistical methods should
   come with a known-truth check (simulate from the model, recover the truth);
   see `inst/validation/` for the pattern used throughout the package.
5. Run `R CMD check` (for example `devtools::check()`) and make sure it passes
   with no errors or warnings.
6. Open a pull request describing what changed and why. The automated checks
   run on Windows, macOS and Linux.

## Code of conduct

Please be respectful and constructive. Harassment or personal attacks are not
tolerated in issues, pull requests or any other project space.
